        <p class = "text-p">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a pieceof   classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock a Latin     professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the moreobscure Latin words,     consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the citesof the word in classical   literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comesfrom sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of     "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes ofGood and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This   book is a treatise on the theory of ethics very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of    Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolorsit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

But who has any right to find fault with a man who choosesto enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that producesno resultant pleasure?</p>

            <p class = "text-p">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
